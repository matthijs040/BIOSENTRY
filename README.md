# BioSentry
Biosentry project: drones, safety and security, digital twin, flight planning, robotics
Drone & video surveillance can help more effectively and efficiently monitor and maintain the new 1.5 meter normal, in parks, 
entertainment centers of cities, on cycle paths in nature reserves, on beaches, shopping centers, furniture boulevards, etc.
On these routes, we want to detect (where possible future) violations of social-distancing rules in particular (e.g. capacity excesses such 
as shoppers' density), report them, and provide real-time feedback to the public, retailers, and / or police services.

For the time being we will store and manage all project files in this little private corner of GitHub; we are still in the process
of detecting the most appropriate licensing model that will be most likely hybrid in nature; some parts of the code will be open sourced,
whilst other parts will become proprietary in nature.
